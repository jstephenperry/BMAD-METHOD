# Retrospective

Review a completed epic by reading the evidence it left — the epic spec, story files, the full diff, per-story commits, and session logs when they exist. An unattended epic run leaves a record; this skill reads that record, surfaces the defects no single story could show, and judges the epic against the criteria it set for itself.

Every finding you report carries a source reference (file, line, commit, or log). A claim you cannot point at — an invented root cause, a pattern the diff does not actually show — is not a finding. Drop it.

## Resolution rules

- Bare paths and `{skill-root}` (e.g. `references/aggregate-views.md`, `scripts/git_evidence.py`) resolve from this skill's installed directory.
- `{project-root}` → the project working directory.
- `{skill-name}` → the skill directory's basename.

## Modes

Interactive by default. With `-H`/`--headless`: skip every confirmation, take the spec folder from the invocation, never open the team discussion, render the verdict on the evidence alone, and record each assumption made without the user (any unfinished stories proceeded over, the machine verdict, each proposed item) into the retrospective document's Assumptions section so the audit trail survives. The Phase 4 acceptance fail-safe still applies in headless runs.

For automation, `-H <spec-folder>` — an explicit spec folder in headless mode — is the stable orchestrator-facing interface. Folder detection is a human convenience, not an automation contract: a headless run with no folder stops and reports.

## On Activation

Run these in order before the retrospective begins:

1. **Resolve the workflow block.** Run `uv run --no-cache {project-root}/_bmad/scripts/resolve_customization.py --skill {skill-root} --key workflow`. If it fails, resolve `{workflow.*}` yourself by reading `{skill-root}/customize.toml`, then `{project-root}/_bmad/custom/{skill-name}.toml`, then `.user.toml` in that order, merging base → team → user (scalars override, keyed arrays-of-tables merge by `code`/`id`, other arrays append).
2. **Run prepend steps** — execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_prepend}` in order.
3. **Load persistent facts** — treat every `{workflow.persistent_facts}` entry as standing context. `file:` entries are paths/globs under `{project-root}` whose contents load as facts; all others are literal facts.
4. **Load config** — run `uv run {project-root}/_bmad/scripts/resolve_config.py --project-root {project-root}` (merges `_bmad/config.toml`, `_bmad/config.user.toml`, and the `_bmad/custom/` overrides). From the merged JSON resolve `project_name`, `user_name`, `communication_language`, `document_output_language`, `output_folder` (under `core`), `user_skill_level`, `planning_artifacts`, `implementation_artifacts` (under `modules.bmm`), and `date` (system datetime); missing keys take neutral defaults, never block. Speak all output in `{communication_language}`; write all documents in `{document_output_language}`. Never state time estimates — AI has changed development speed, so hour/day/week predictions are noise.
5. **Greet and orient** (interactive only). Greet `{user_name}`, name the epic you are about to retro, and optionally invite their going-in concerns ("anything you want weighted — a story that felt rushed, a risky interaction between two stories?"). Use any answer to focus the Phase 1–2 analysis; it directs attention but never becomes a finding without a source.
6. **Run append steps** — execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_append}` in order.

## Inputs

| Input | Where | Use |
|-------|-------|-----|
| spec folder | invocation argument, or found under the spec roots | the epic: `SPEC.md`, ordered `stories.yaml`, `stories/<id>-*.md` |
| architecture / prd | `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*`, `*prd*` | context for judging as-built vs intended |
| previous retros (optional) | `RETROSPECTIVE.md` in the sibling spec folders under the spec roots | check whether earlier epics' action items landed |
| session logs (optional) | conversation/session records for the epic's stories | process lessons; record the gap when absent |

An epic reaches this skill as a spec folder holding `SPEC.md`, an ordered `stories.yaml`, and `stories/<id>-*.md` artifacts — the shape a build run leaves behind. A named folder is the epic. With none, look for spec folders under `{output_folder}/specs`, `{planning_artifacts}`, and `{implementation_artifacts}`; ask the user which to retro when there is more than one, and never choose silently; headless, stop and require an explicit folder.

`stories.yaml` in list order is the story list — list order is authoritative, filename sort is not — and each story's `stories/<id>-*.md` frontmatter carries its `status`. `pending_stories` is the ids whose status is not `done`, in list order; a story with no artifact file counts as pending. A missing or unparseable `stories.yaml` means the completeness check cannot run: say so, record that it did not run, and continue only if the user (or the headless Assumptions trail) accepts proceeding without it.

Then check the epic is actually finished before Phase 1. `pending_stories` is scoped to this epic alone (an unfinished story in some *other* spec folder is out of scope for this retrospective). When the list is non-empty, interactively list those stories and ask whether to retro an unfinished epic: if the user declines, stop and report — do not enter Phase 1; if they accept, record the stories they accepted proceeding over in the document's Epic summary. Headless, proceed and record the same list in the Assumptions section — do not invent a confirmation. Either way the list sits in the document, and Phase 4's machine verdict is **rejected** when any story remained unfinished (see `references/acceptance-verdict.md`); a human may override interactively.

## Working state and resumption

The retrospective document is the working artifact, not only the final output. Once the epic is fixed, create it as a skeleton (`references/retro-document.md` names the sections) and write each phase's result into it as you finish — inventory, then findings with sources, then dispositions and verdict. Continuity is re-reading the file.

If a retrospective document for this epic already exists, load it, reconcile its recorded state against the current evidence — the current evidence wins, since commits may have landed and questions may have been answered since — and resume at the first incomplete phase instead of redoing finished ones. That document is `{spec-folder}/RETROSPECTIVE.md`, a fixed name so a resumed run finds it.

## Flow

Run the phases in order. A default run stops at a written evidence report and verdict; the team discussion in Phase 3 is opt-in.

### Phase 1 — Gather

Enumerate what the epic actually produced and record what is missing. Load `references/evidence-gathering.md` for the inventory checklist, the `git_evidence.py` pre-pass that derives the diff range and per-story commits, and the missing-evidence rule: each later analysis declares what it needs and records a narrowed scope when the evidence is absent, so a reader can always tell "checked and clean" from "never checked."

### Phase 2 — Analyze

Produce findings, each with a source reference, from three angles:

- **Aggregate views** — the defects no single diff hunk shows: architecture delta, duplication map, god-class growth, pattern divergence, spec-to-implementation reconciliation. Load `references/aggregate-views.md` for the catalog and how to derive each (deterministic scripts first).
- **Diff-scope review** — do not reimplement review. Invoke **`bmad-review`** on the epic's diff for the code lenses (adversarial, edge-case, verification-gap), weighting the boundaries between stories, where no single session ever saw both sides. Fold its findings in. If `bmad-review` is unavailable, run those lenses inline over the diff on a narrowed scope and record the narrowing.
- **Behavior check (when the epic changed runtime behavior)** — exercise the changed flows end to end and record what you observed. Passing tests do not substitute for running the system.

Consolidate: merge, dedupe, and provenance-link findings. Drop any finding you cannot tie to a source.

### Phase 3 — Team Discussion (opt-in)

Skip by default; never runs headless. When the user asks to "discuss it as a team," "run party mode," or similar, invoke the skill `bmad-party-mode` seeded with the Phase 2 findings so the installed agents react to real evidence — the god class the diff really grew, the verification gap that is actually there, the wins the evidence confirms. Load `references/team-discussion.md` for how to seed it and keep it grounded. If `bmad-party-mode` is unavailable, run the discussion inline over the Phase 2 findings and record the narrowing. The rule: agents speak only to findings with sources.

### Phase 4 — Decide

- **Action items** — compile fix-now findings and process lessons into specific, owned action items. Fixes and spec reconciliations are *proposed here*, not auto-applied; the human decides what to execute.
- **Acceptance verdict** — judge the final state against the epic's declared acceptance criteria (profile it from the diff and stories if none were declared): **accepted**, **accepted-with-open-items**, or **rejected** — one spelling, everywhere a machine reads it. Unfinished stories in `pending_stories` force the machine verdict to **rejected**. A human decision always overrides. An epic that fails its criteria with no human decision is recorded as *not accepted* — never as silently accepted. Load `references/acceptance-verdict.md` for the rubric, the finding-routing dispositions, and the previous-retro follow-through record — the per-item evidence Phase 5's status offer reads.

### Phase 5 — Finalize

Finalize `{spec-folder}/RETROSPECTIVE.md` — load `references/retro-document.md` for the document's sections — and stop there: it is the run's only write, with no edits to `SPEC.md`, `stories.yaml`, or any story artifact. Where the Phase 4 follow-through has evidence a *previous* epic's action item landed, record the status it argues for in the Previous-retro follow-through section; the evidence justifies proposing a transition, and only the user, in that earlier retrospective's document, closes the item. Then, if `{workflow.on_complete}` is non-empty, follow it as the final instruction.
